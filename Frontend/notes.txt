In this file I will be writing down my personal notes during the development process.

# creating svelte frontend template
    open cmd go into projectfolder then 'degit sveltejs/template Frontend'

# main.js is the mainfile svelte uses to start our app
# App.svelte is the root of our app

# installing the dependencies from package.json
    open terminal and then 'npm install'
    after doing this in the folder structure there will be a new folder called 'node_modules' and another .json file

# opening up the dev server
    in terminal type 'npm run dev'

# in each svelte component (fileName.svelte) we can have up to 3 parts
    - a script tag for the component logic
    - am html template thats gonna be injected
    - a style tag for the current component
