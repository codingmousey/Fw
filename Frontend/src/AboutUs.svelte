  <h2>About Junior Job</h2>
  <p>
    At Junior Job, my mission is to help new grads and students still in school
    find their introduction into the developer world. The website provides a
    centralized platform where individuals can access all junior jobs in one
    place, making the job search process easier and more efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    This platform benefits both job seekers and employers. Job seekers can
    easily browse through a wide variety of junior job opportunities, while
    employers and schools can connect with qualified candidates who are
    specifically targeting junior level positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the platform is updated daily with new job postings, making
    sure that users have access to the most up-to-date job listings. I use
    automation through a python script to streamline the process of posting new
    job listings, making it convenient for both employers and job seekers.
